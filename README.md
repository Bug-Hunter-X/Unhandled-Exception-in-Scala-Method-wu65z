This repository demonstrates a common Scala coding error: improper exception handling. The `bug.scala` file shows code that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` but lacks comprehensive error handling.  The `bugSolution.scala` file provides a corrected version with improved exception management and potentially alternative approaches. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in production-level Scala applications.
